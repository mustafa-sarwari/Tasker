# Tasker

Tasker is a simple and intuitive web-based task management app that lets users add, view, and remove tasks easily. It saves tasks locally in the browser so they persist across sessions. The app also includes confirmation before deleting tasks to prevent accidental removal.

## Features

- Add new tasks with an expanding textarea input  
- Remove tasks with a confirmation prompt  
- Tasks persist in browser localStorage, so they stay after page reload  
- Simple, clean, and responsive UI  
- Lightweight and easy to use  

## Demo

## How to Use

1. Type your task into the textarea.  
2. Click the **Add** button to add the task to the list.  
3. Each task has a **Remove** button; click it to delete the task after confirming.  
4. Tasks will be saved automatically and remain after refreshing the page.
